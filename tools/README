This directory contains source codes of (mainly C) programs involved in the Vowpam Wabbit (VW) based read classification pipeline :
* `drawfrag' is used to draw fragments from reference genomes
* `fasta2vw' is used to convert a fasta file into a plain text file compliant with VW
* `enumerateKmers' is used to enumerate all kmers of a given length in a file
  compliant with VW. It is used to extract the model parameters.
* `parseHash' is used to convert an 'inverted' VW model into a binary file
  containing model parameters.
* `spectrumpredict' is ued to make predictions from such a binary file and a
  standard fasta file.

These tools rely on two existing libraries :
* the GDL library that implements (among  other thing) many file manipulation utilities and data structures (e.g., list and hash tables)
* the KSEQ library that is used to manipulate fasta and fastq files
These two libraries are included in the "ext" directory.

The `INSTALL.sh' bash script (of the parent directory) carries out the installation of these tools : 
* installation of the GDL library (installed here in ext/gdl-1.2/GDL)
* installation of these tools

To run is, you should type at the prompt:
$ sh INSTALL.sh

The `test' directory contains a simple script illustrating how to use these tools on a small fasta file.
