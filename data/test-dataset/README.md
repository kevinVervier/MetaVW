  * test-db.abundance: a two-columns file (sequence_id : relative_abundance) required for simulations with Grinder software.
  * test-db.fasta: a FASTA file that contains the 398 sequences related to 193 species used to simulate validation sets.
  * test-db.meta: a five-columns file containing metadata on test-db genomes, like sequence.id, genome.id and the corresponding taxon IDs at strain, species and genus levels.
  * test-db.species-level.taxid: a one-column file that contains the species-level taxid for each sequence in the _test_ database.
